    BIO 419/519 Winter 2019 - Data Science for Biologists
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="teaching/422-522/index.html">AMATH 422/522 Fall 2017</a> -
    Introduction to Computational Models in Biology
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My experience qualifies me to teach courses in:
  </p>
    <lo>
      <li />Core mathematics
      <li />Applied math
      <li />Data science
      <li />Programming and scientific computing
      <li />Networks and graph theory
      <li />Mathematical biology
      <li />Machine learning and statistical inference
    </lo>

  <h4>Summer Workshop on the Dynamic Brain</h4>
  <p> I was one of the instructors at the 2016 "summer camp" for 
    graduate student and postdoctoral neuroscientists.
    We taught computational neuroscience techniques and
    scientific Python programming, including how to use the 
    <a href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/AllenSDK">Allen Institute for Brain Science SDK</a>
    to access and analyze their data.
    To teach, we developed a set of Jupyter notebooks, interactive
    Python worksheets with coding examples, documentation, and exercizes.

    <li /><a href="https://github.com/AllenBrainAtlas/SWDB-2016">SWDB code</a>
    <li /><a href="https://github.com/AllenBrainAtlas/SWDB-2016/blob/master/DynamicBrain/Connectivity.ipynb">Connectivity notebook</a> from my team
    <li /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmYkj1FImpI">SWDB video</a>-
    The Allen Institute produced a great video to promote the course.
    I am interviewed!

  <h4>Mentoring</h4>
  <p>
    I worked closely with Joshua Mendoza on his undergraduate senior thesis
    project in applied mathematics, "The effects of network structure in
    creating a two-phase breathing pattern in the Botzinger and pre-Botzinger
    complexes".  
    Josh was a Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation scholar,
    graduated with honors,
    and continued working on our project as a postbac.
    He was able to contribute to our 
    <a href="https://github.com/kharris/prebotc-graph-model">model code</a>
    and wrote his own section (Section 2.3) in our paper 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04258">Differential roles
      for inhibition in excitatory rhythm generators</a>.
    Josh is now working as a data scientist at 
    Pacific Northwest National Labs.
  </p>
