<body><h1>Chanterelle</h1>
<h2><span style="font-style: italic;">Cantharellus
spp.</span></h2>
<p>Chanterelles are some of the most prized edible mushrooms.
They grow throughout Vermont and have never been successfully
cultivated because cultivators are unable to replicate the symbiotic
mycorrhizal relationship that the chanterelle mycelium forms with
surrounding trees. They typically grow under oaks and conifers, often
in large patches. The young fruitbodies start with convex caps which
flatten and then become cup-shaped with age. Gills ascend up the stalk.
Instead of picking a large crop all at once, it is better to pick only
those mushrooms that are mature and almost gone-by, since the mature
fruits can double in size from when the cap first becomes convex. The
mushrooms pictured are not quite ready for picking. Even people
unfamiliar with mushroom hunting can look for chanterelles because of
the relative ease and safety of identification (they are a distinct
bright orange without any close and harmful look-alike).</p>
<p>Although these are choice and expensive mushrooms (retailing
for around $60 per
dry pound), they are not in danger from over-harvesting. As soon as
mushrooms reach maturity, they begin to drop spores which are quickly
whisked away by the wind, sometimes traveling miles. The main body of
the fungus, the mycelium, actually lives underground. A mushroom hunter
is only picking the part of the fungus that distributes spores. Even
so, they should be careful not to damage the underlying mycelial
network. Cutting the mushrooms at the base of the stem is the desirable
for this. It also eliminates the extra work of brushing dirt off the
base of the stem.</p>
<p>Socially and culturally, mushroom hunting is
a great activity. People can go for fun forays into the woods. There
they can walk alongside folks familiar with all types of mushrooms,
learning as they go. You can learn all you want about the species, but
you will have to find your own patches, since they are usually kept
secret. Mycological clubs organize these kinds of events; in Vermont
there are the Vermont Mycology Club in Burlington and the Northeast
Kingdom Mushroom Society. The state is also full of mushroom growers of
other species. Many people are familiar with fungi, having learned from
their parents and friends, and will be happy to take any newcomer into
the woods.</p>
