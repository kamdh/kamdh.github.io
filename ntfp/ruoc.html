<body><h1>Black Raspberry</h1>
<h2><span style="font-style: italic;">Rubus
occidentalis</span></h2>
<p>Thompson describes blackberries (to which black raspberries
are closely related) as &ldquo;universally regarded as the most
wholesome and delicious wild berry found in the state&rdquo;
(Thompson 220). Wild berries are one of the most commonly picked wild
plants. They are familiar and easy to identify, taste great in many
forms, and have a long tradition of use. What Vermonter cannot recall
berry picking with their family as a child?</p>
<p>Plants of the genus <i>Rubus</i> are called by
the common name of
brambles. Blackberries and their relations, including black
raspberry, are part of this genus. Brambles are distinguished from
raspberries and their relatives because the vines
&ldquo;ramble&rdquo; instead of forming straight stalks. Black
raspberry's fruits are smaller than raspberry's. They are tart when
young, becoming sweeter when mature. The black raspberry has sweeter
fruit than blackberry. Most berries contain high levels of
disease-preventing antioxidants. In black raspberries these are
anthocyanins and ellagic acid (Wikipedia).</p>
<p>Black raspberries are not the most cultivated berries in
Vermont. Regular raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries surpass
them by far, according to the website of the Vermont Vegetable and
Berry Growers Association. This group is a resource available for
cultivators in the state. They hold meetings and publish a newsletter,
helping farmers share knowledge.</p>
<p>Because black raspberries are not a common cultivar, they are
more familiar to us as a wild plant. The most enjoyable thing about
berry picking is finding a patch on the trail and picking them as you
ramble through the brambles. Picking in the wild is much more of a
cultural experience. It creates a connection between the harvester and
the land. It is this direct connection that makes black raspberry more
ethnobotanically significant than more common, cultivated species.</p><img style="width: 440px; height: 293px;" alt="(Image credit: Jennifer Anderson @ USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database)" src="images/ruoc.jpg" /><br />
