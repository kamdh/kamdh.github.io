<body><h1>Milkweed</h1>
<h2><span style="font-style: italic;">Asclepias syriaca</span></h2>
<p>Common milkweed is a plant easily found in the Vermont flora, as well as throughout America. Given the scientific name of <span style="font-style: italic;">Asclepias syriaca</span> and of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Asclepiadaceae</span>
or milkweed family, it is also known as wild cotton, Virginia silk,
silk weed, and cotton weed, and is known for its characteristic milky
sap and silky hairs that are attached to the seeds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Milkweed shoots first begins to emerge around mid April or May, and
it goes on to flower later in the summer, from around June to early
August. Its flowers, which are produced in abundance, are small and
form sphere like clusters that have a delicate purplish-pink or white
color. Each of these fragrant flowers has its own long stalk, and the
fruit it produces are teardrop-shaped pods. It is in these hairy
grayish-green pods that the seeds are contained &ndash; over two
hundred seeds in each pod when they open and disperse in early fall. By
the time the pods open, it is also common for the plant to have turned
reddish in color.</p>
<p>The seeds of the common milkweed are flat, oval, and, as stated,
have big tufts of silky white hairs attached to them. These hairs
facilitate seed dispersal by wind, as opposed to relying on animals to
distribute the seeds; however, milkweed is known for attracting the
monarch butterfly, which is why this type of butterfly is sometimes
dubbed the milkweed butterfly (Johnson 241). When winter comes, the
pods remain on the stems and turn brown with a shiny yellow interior.
This perennial flower is commonly found along meadows and on roadsides,
giving it the reputation as a weed. Its growth is a big problem with
no-till and reduced-tillage agriculture areas (Uva 102). Milkweed
prefers to grow in well-drained soils and does not like frequent
mowing. But that has not hampered its spread all over America: in the
North-East, down south to Virginia and Georgia, and west to the Rocky
Mountains.</p>
<p>The growing period of the common milkweed actually begins in winter
when its root buds emerge, however the seedlings do not start to flower
until after the plant&rsquo;s first year. When milkweed is young, its
leaves are dark green, waxy, pointed, opposite, and have a large white
vein up the center of the leaf. As the plant matures, the upright stems
lose their branches, become hollow and covered in hairs, and all parts
of the plant exude the milky sap for which the plant was named. The
upper part of the mature leaf is smooth and dark green, with the bottom
part being hairy and lighter in color. The roots of this plant are
thick, fleshy, and white and grow to be quite extensive.</p><p>The common milkweed is very closely related to the hemp dogbane (<span style="font-style: italic;">Apocynum cannabinum</span>),
another plant native to Vermont that was traditionally used as medicine
and for making cordage. There are some differentiating characteristics:
the leaves of the hemp dogbane are smaller than those of milkweed, and
its stems have many branches. The flowers are similar, except that the
dogbane&rsquo;s are smaller, greenish-white, and bell shaped. The
fruits too share similar qualities, but those of the hemp dogbane are
longer, more narrow, and curved, unlike those of milkweed.</p><p>Milkweed
is a valuable plant because it can be used for many different crafts,
and it is edible. The silk fibers attached to the seeds can be used to
make cord &ndash; for clothes, ropes, or other such crafts (Coon 29).
Milkweed is also called a &ldquo;rubber plant&rdquo; along with
goldenrod and yellow bells, because its milky sap can be used as a
substitute for rubber &ndash; not a good one, but a substitute
nonetheless. In fact, during World War II when there was a rubber
shortage, children in Vermont were sent out to collect milkweed, and
the sap was used as &ldquo;a rather sorry substitute&rdquo; for rubber
(Emery, Rood 101). It was also rumored that milkweed&rsquo;s silky
fibers were collected to use as stuffing in life vests during World War
II, however there is no solid information to back up this claim
(Emery). Like its relatives in the dogbane family (<span style="font-style: italic;">Apocynaceae</span>), milkweed was used by Native Americans to make string, twine, nets, and even clothing (Coon 62).</p><p>The
medicinal qualities of milkweed include is reputed abilities to cure
warts and as a diuretic. Some varieties of the milkweed family are even
reputed to cure cancer; however, none of this information has been
proven (Coon 71). Milkweed&rsquo;s many uses also explain why its
scientific name refers to the so-called &ldquo;father of
medicine,&rdquo; Aesculapius, a Greek who was born about one hundred
years before Christ. Given that milkweed is such an American plant, it
seems odd that its scientific name would refer to an ancient Greek
doctor (Coon 70). Milkweed is one of those typically American plants:
it is not only indigenous to the New World, but it is one of those
plants that grow in everyone&rsquo;s backyard. Today, however, only
dedicated nature buffs use milkweed for any practical purposes (Emery).
Although this plant is called a &ldquo;weed,&rdquo; it holds a special
place in many Americans' hearts because of its unique and useful
qualities.</p><img style="width: 300px; height: 440px;" alt="(Image credit: Larry Allain @ USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database)" src="images/assy.jpg" /><br /><p><a href="http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ASSY">PLANTS
