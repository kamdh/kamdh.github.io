<body><h1>Wild Leek</h1>
<h2><span style="font-style: italic;">Allium
tricoccum</span></h2>
<p>The leek species is a plant that can be found all over the
world and has been used throughout human history, dating back to the
days of ancient Egypt. Part of the Lily family (<span style="font-style: italic;">Liliaceae</span>), wild
leeks are a variation of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Allium</span>
species, which also includes plants like onions, garlics, chives,
shallots, and other kinds of leeks. This species is known for being an
edible and has a very distinctive and appetizing taste that is used to
flavor many different types of cuisine. When used in ordinary cooking,
it is the leaves of the plant that are being used. Wild leeks and their
relatives also have a fairly pungent smell, especially evident when the
skin of the plant is broken and the juices start flowing. Besides just
being good for cooking, these plants are also known for their medicinal
uses, and when eaten regularly they are said to keep the eater in good
health. Other medicinal uses that this species is reputed to have is as
an antiseptic, along with being good for helping asthma, bronchitis,
coughs, colds, and is used as a vermifuge (to expel worms and
parasites) (Seymour 172). Members of the wild leek&rsquo;s family
are also rumored to cure poison ivy, and the skins of some can even be
used to create dyes.</p>
<p>Wild leek grows in rich woods and floodplain forests mainly
where the soil is thick with nutrients, especially calcium, a mineral
it prefers. Given that the soil in Vermont is rich in calcium due to
the abundance of calcium rich rocks in this area, wild leeks are
particularly suited to grow in Vermont. The floodplain forests, with
their especially rich soils, where the leeks grow are home to many
unique animals and plants. In fact, the botanical diversity of these
rich forests is greater than anywhere else in Vermont, and the wild
leek shares its habitat with plants such as bloodroot, blue cohosh, and
other medicinals (Johnson 108). Wild leeks are also thought to grow
near vernal pools in these rich woods of Vermont, which are depressions
in the ground where water gathers and because no fish live there, other
insects and microscopic creatures are able to breed and grow without
being eaten or killed off. In the growth cycle of the wild leek, the
leaves will start to emerge in the spring, but it is not until those
leaves have died off that the flowers emerge sometime in late spring to
early summer.</p>
<p>This is a plant that is very common and is found all over Vermont.
It blankets forest floors, and is especially prominent near riverbanks
(Johnson 108). The wild leek was originally called <span style="font-style: italic;">winooski</span>
by the Abenaki Native Americans who were native to Vermont. Because of
the wild leeks&rsquo; abundant growth along the bank of the Winooski
River, that river and the town nearby were named after this plant.
After agriculture became widespread across the state of Vermont,
farmers wanted to eradicate wild leeks because the cows would eat them
and it made their milk taste like onions and so they would send their
sons out to pick it in early spring (Emery). Wild leeks are a very
hearty species though, and they still thrive all over Vermont.</p>
<p>The wild leek is a very common and valuable plant to the
Vermont countryside. It can be used in many different ways, and has had
a large societal impact as well, influencing the area so much as to
have a river and a town named after it. While wild leek and its family
members can be found all over the world and have been used for ages,
its impact has not been forgotten in Vermont where it is still growing
strong.</p><img style="width: 440px; height: 300px;" alt="(Image credit: Thomas G. Barnes @ USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database / Barnes, T.G. &amp; S.W. Francis. 2004. Wildflowers and ferns of Kentucky.
