<body><h1>American Ginseng</h1>
<h2><span style="font-style: italic;">Panax
quinquefolius</span></h2>
<p>Ginseng is one of the most sought-after wild plants in Vermont
and is by far the most valuable. Its name is an anglicized form of the
Chinese words meaning "like a man". This refers to the shape of the
root, the active part of the plant.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Panax ginseng</span>,
native to China, has been used there for thousands of years. The root
is used medicinally as a cure-all and prized as the best aphrodisiac.
The aphrodisiac effect was confirmed by Brigham, who said the effect
manifested in erotic dreams for him after taking a large amount of
ginseng one time. A similar species called American ginseng (<span style="font-style: italic;">P. quinquefolius</span>)
once grew abundantly in the range of the Appalachian mountains, from
Georgia North to Canada. (From now on any use of
&ldquo;ginseng&rdquo; will refer <span style="font-style: italic;">P. quinquefolius</span>.)
Interestingly, the American Indians called their ginseng "the little
man" similar to the Chinese. They knew about ginseng's medicinal
properties and it was used for many of the same afflictions as in China
(USDA NRCS 2006).</p>
<p>Ginseng is an especially long-lived plant with a slow life
cycle. It grows in heavy shade, on East- and North-facing slopes with
well-drained soil under deciduous trees (Brigham, Hankins). It can
pollinate both sexually and asexually and propagates by seed. A mature
plant produces berries that, when mature, are bright red. The plant has
distinct stages of life, usually characterized by the number of
compound leaves (prongs). The first year seedling plant grows with only
one prong. In general, ginseng grows two prongs the second year, and
three prongs after at least three years. Although it may flower in the
third year, plants are not considered mature until they are five years
old (Brigham, &ldquo;Good
Stewardship Harvesting of Wild American Ginseng&rdquo;).
Each year the frost kills off the leafy top, but the root survives
underground. The &ldquo;neck&rdquo; of the root is scarred each
year and can thus be examined to determine age. For example: a plant
with four scars is at least five years old. Ginseng is versatile and
can live dormant underground if it has to. The plant will not grow a
new scar that year, so it is better to say the plant is <span style="font-style: italic;">at least</span> as old as
the number of scars. It is not known how long ginseng can live. The
most ancient plants have already been harvested. Brigham reported
finding plants with more than 20 scars, so many that the neck of the
root was longer than an arm-length. He estimated the oldest plants he
found had probably lived for nearly 100 years.</p>
<p>The medical action of ginseng is attributed to its unique
class of compounds called ginsenosides. It has been used for type II
diabetes as well as to improve mental performance (ginseng is a central
nervous system stimulant). It is also used for many other illnesses,
but there is &ldquo;unclear scientific evidence&rdquo; for
these uses (&ldquo;Ginseng&rdquo;).
Research is ongoing.</p>
<p>Europeans became aware of ginseng in
1716, when Jesuit priest Joseph Lafitau of Quebec heard about <span style="font-style: italic;">P.
ginseng</span> from another Jesuit in China who mentioned that
the valuable
Chinese root grew in habitats similar to Quebec and New England (Gabel
12). Over-harvesting in China made the root extremely rare and thus
very profitable. An international trade was established between Quebec
and China. It then spread south into the British territories.
&ldquo;Vermont&rdquo; was one of the first regions involved in
the ginseng trade (it was not a state yet) and it was important for the
state's livelihood (Gabel 12, Thompson 221).</p><p>At its
peak, wild ginseng could fetch up to $600 per dry pound but now brings
in around $300-400 per pound (Brigham, Hankins). Price varies
drastically with quality. The best roots come from the oldest plants,
valued because they are more gnarled and &ldquo;break with a
somewhat soft and waxy texture&rdquo; (Stockberger). They must also
be properly dried. The Chinese market is very picky about the ginseng
they want. The more branches the root has, the more gnarled and twisted
it is, and the darker its color, the more desirable it is. The reasons
for this preference are based in the Chinese system of medicine which
says the roots gain potency as they age. It also more resembles the
roots of <span style="font-style: italic;">P. ginseng</span>
(Brigham, Hankins). In &ldquo;the early 1750s, when the market
crashed due to an over-abundance of small, poor-quality roots being
shipped to China&rdquo; the Vermont ginseng market suffered
significantly (Gabel).</p><p>Cultivators of ginseng must
strive to simulate the natural growing conditions that make a product
the market wants. Cultivated roots are often shaped more like a carrot
than the man that markets want. Growers often over-fertilize when
striving for higher yields, and this further hurts the quality of the
product. These lower-grade roots, from cultivation under artificial
shade, sometimes fetch as little as $10 per pound. China is now growing
its own supply of lower-grade ginseng and many growers are now out of
business. With agroforestry, farmers can cultivate ginseng with all the
characteristics of the wild root. This takes more patience and careful
site planning (both to ensure a good crop and protect from thieves)
than with artificial shade and the yields are lower. At the moment,
however, this is the only economically viable type of cultivation in
America (Hankins).</p><p>Currently, only one company is
cultivating wild-simulated ginseng in Vermont, Vermont Woodland
Ginseng. Their product is NOFA-VT certified organic, and sells for $25
an ounce. Brigham grew the crop in his youth as a sort of
&ldquo;ginseng bank account.&rdquo; As a boy, he transplanted
wild seedlings and berries out of the deep woods to places closer to
home. Experimenting with different locations, he realized that the
plant needs very specific soil and shade to thrive. The best spots are
undisturbed. The presence of other herbaceous (often rare) plants can
be an indication of a good site (Brigham, Hankins). Brigham also noted
that the dirt will taste good, almost sweet. Later on, Brigham worked
to establish large patch in a secret location with collected wild
berries. In the fifth year, however, he had pest problems which
decimated the crop. He ended up netting very little money and gave up
the enterprise.</p><p>The demand for ginseng has greatly
reduced its populations. Before the export trade was established,
ginseng was widespread and could often be found in dense, extensive
patches. The first diggers could sometimes bring in &ldquo;daily
harvests of 10-60 pounds... per person&rdquo; (Gabel 12). Thompson,
writing in 1852, remarked that ginseng at that time was already scarce
(221). Timber logging also reduced the populations of ginseng (Gabel
12-13, Thompson 221). Following the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) in 1975, ginseng
exportation became regulated in 19 states, including Vermont. In
Vermont, the root can be legally harvested only on private property
with a permit between August 20 and October 10. The plants must be five
years old with at least three prongs, and the berries must be replanted.</p><p>Wild
populations are not regularly monitored in Vermont, however (Gabel). It
is on the state watch list. Ginseng is listed
&ldquo;S2S3&rdquo; in Gabel's report, giving it an
imperiled/vulnerable status with probably less than 80 populations.
Hopefully, agroforestry methods will mitigate market pressures that
drive over-harvesting of wild populations. This will only be assured
when wild-simulated ginseng is properly cultivated and brings in prices
comparable wild root.</p><p>In the 18th and 19th century, a
whole culture developed around digging what was sometimes called
&ldquo;old sang.&rdquo; Ginseng was alluring because of its
remarkable value; any old country bumpkin could get rich quick if they
found a big patch. Ginseng was never taken in as medicine extensively
in Vermont, but people recognized it had special powers. Ginseng
diggers are rumored to live longer than others, and one story we
gleaned from Brigham illustrates that:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">This
Vermonter, whom Brigham
knew, grew up in a professional, educated family. The digger was bright
but not interested in studying as his brothers and dedicated himself
instead to sports and wandering the woods; sometimes he would dig
ginseng. After high school he was drafted to play for the Red Sox the
year the ball club formed. After playing baseball for a while, he
decided to return to Vermont, the land he loved, and dig ginseng.
Brigham knew him as a lively and healthy being and he always seemed
young for his age. His whole life he lived with a great big hernia in
his stomach. The doctors recommended he remove it when he was older,
but he said he had had it with him his whole life and he had got along
fine so far. He eventually died, and it was not until then that people
learned he had been lying about his age his whole life and was actually
more than a decade older than anyone thought. According to Brigham,
being around ginseng, deep in the oldest, most fertile woods, gives one
energy and keeps one healthy throughout their life.</p>
<p>Ginseng
is a big part of Vermont's history. It was once a very cultural plant
as well, which is why its decline is so sad. Hopefully we will preserve
what wild population is left for future ginseng hunters, looking for a
little piece of their own &ldquo;gold&rdquo; in the woods.</p>
