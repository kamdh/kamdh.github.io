        <h2>Learning in an unusual year</h2>
        <p>This academic quarter is not normal. We are all adjusting to the new online environment and many of us may be dealing with extra stress and uncertainty. My goal is to facilitate your learning as best I can.</p>
        <p>The class is listed as synchronous (Zoom), however a minority of lessons will be provided asynchronously (video posted to Google drive). The class schedule (this website) will keep you up to date at least a week in advance about which lessons require synchronous attendance. I will also be offering multiple office hours, but if these do not work for you and you would like to meet, send me an email with 3 times that will work for you.</p>
        <h2>Course description and outcomes</h2>
        <p>Covers important machine learning research areas such as neural nets, kernel methods, graphical models, Bayesian learning, decision tree learning, evolutionary computation and computational learning theory. Models and algorithms from these research areas will be analyzed.</p>
        <p>On completion of CSCI 471, students will demonstrate:
          <ul>
            <li />A thorough understanding of classification, regression and clustering.
            <li />A thorough understanding of supervised and unsupervised learning.
            <li />A basic understanding of assorted, advanced machine learning algorithms.
            <li />A basic understanding of feature selection and transformation.
            <li />The ability to implement standard machine learning algorithms and run machine learning experiments.
          </ul>

          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>All students will be graded on homework assignments, participation and quizzes, and a final project. There will be no exams. For 571 students, there is also a slideshow presentation of an advanced machine learning topic to the class. Sometimes there will be extra, more difficult problems in the homework which will only be graded for grad students.
          <ul>
            <li />Homework: 70%, Final project: 20%, Participation & quizzes: 10%
            <li />571 students: multiply the above numbers by 90% and add 10% for your presentation
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I may curve grades at the end of the course if it provides a spread of grades that more accurately represents the quality of work in the class. I will only do this if it improves your grade.</p>

        <h2>Participation and quizzes</h2>
        <p>Part of your grade will reflect whether or not you attend the synchronous sessions, since these will be interactive and the class will benefit from being able to ask questions and work in breakout groups. Short quizzes may be used to check your understanding of background and recently covered material.</p>

        <h2>Deadlines</h2>
        <p>Please refer to this website for the most up-to-date deadlines. You have 2 late days that you can use for up to two assignments (i.e., you may submit 1 assignment 2 days late or 2 assignments 1 day late each). If you miss a deadline or expect to miss one due to a medical or family emergency, please contact me as soon as possible to discuss arrangements.</p>

        <h2>Submitting your work</h2>
        <p>Program and project code will be developed and stored in git version control repositories, which can be accessed in Linux using the command line client. Specifically, we will use private github repositories under the "kamdh-teaching" organization. You will receive an invitation link to create a repository for each assignment, complete the assignment in a local copy of the repo, and submit by pushing your final changes to GitHub. You will receive feedback in the same repository in a branch called "grading."</p>
        <p>Written homework must be submitted in a single PDF, with any math preferably typeset in LaTeX. You may write an assignment out by hand and scan it, but it must be legible and neat. Using your phone as a “scanner” is not ideal but okay so long as the result is as legible as a good photocopy, cropped, and submitted as a single PDF.</p>
        <p>For group homework assignments, each student must write up and submit their own answers to the assignment. List everyone you worked with.</p>

        <h2>Homework guidelines</h2>
        <p><b>Teamwork</b> is allowed on the assignments unless it is explicitly an individual assignment or problem.  Working in groups is one of the best ways to learn from each other. An ideal group size is 3 people, since it's hard for everyone to contribute in large groups.</p>
        <p>Each student must write up and submit their own answers to the assignment, with all group members listed. That means you may discuss the steps in an algorithm or mathematical argument, but write it out or type the code yourself. Doing this helps fix the ideas in your memory. Don't copy-paste from colleagues or the internet. Do not post your code to the internet.</p>
        <p><b>Math problems</b> are graded for correctness and quality of explanation ("X follows from Y, because Z"). If you make a math mistake early on that leads to an incorrect final result, you will still receive partial credit if the rest of the logic is sound.</p>
        <p><b>Writing assignments</b> are graded like a writing class, since communication is an important skill even for engineers and other technical people.</p>
        <p><b>Coding language:</b> We will be working exclusively in python 3, one of the most common languages of machine learning practitioners. For the assignments, you will be required to write your own algorithms using basic linear algebra routines in numpy and scipy but <i>without</i> any machine learning-specific libraries such as scikit-learn. Which packages are allowed in a given assignment will be specified. In any case, your programs must run on the department computers running Linux. If installing python on your home machine, I recommend the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda distribution</a>.</p>
        <p><b>Programs</b> will be graded on correctness, clarity, and efficiency (in that order).
          <ul>
            <li /><p>Correctness: A correct program is one that always produces the correct output for a given input. Also, a correct program does not produce unintended side-effects. The most effective way to ensure that your program is correct is to test each component as you introduce it; once you are confident that a component works you can use it in other routines and test them. Try to break your program in testing, and if you succeed, locate the bug and fix it. Most of your grade will depend on the correctness of your code.</p>
            <li /><p>Clarity: The easier it is to read and maintain your code, the easier it is to locate and remove bugs. Your program should be organized, appropriately commented, and easy to maintain. To have a well-organized program, design your program thoughtfully and modularly. Think before you code: hacking away blindly leads to ugly, hard to read code. If you do hack away, producing a functional but ugly wall of code, check it into your version control repository and try to clean it up a bit. If your cleaning introduces bugs you can always revert back to the original version. If you have two separate code blocks doing essentially the same thing, try to create one subroutine and call it from both places (copying and pasting code is a big red flag). The less code you have to maintain the fewer chances to introduce bugs (and the less code to change when you find a bug).</p>
        <p>Please follow these simple commenting guidelines proposed by Emeritus Professor Osborne:
            <ul>
              <li />A comment at the top of the program states the program's purpose, the author(s), and date.
              <li />Each subprocedure is accompanied by a comment that states its purpose and describes pre and post conditions, and mentions any exceptions raised.
              <li />Within a procedure, precede code sections by a comment that says what the section does.
              <li />Occasionally, in tricky pieces of code, a comment to the right explains what the code does.
              <li />For each major variable, a comment explains it purpose.
              <li />Don't over comment. Brief is best, but not so brief as to be cryptic.
            </ul>
        </p>
            <li /><p>Efficiency: Your programs should be efficient, but I also want you to understand the individual operations in our machine learning algorithms. In some cases, we will be implementing algorithms which are not "state-of-the-art" in order to learn.</p>
          </ul>
        </p>
